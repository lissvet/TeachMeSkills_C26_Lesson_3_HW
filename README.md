Homework for the third lesson.  
In main_homework_3:  
In class Task_1 we made an explicit cast of a variable type double to an int type.  
In class Task_2 we added variables with type char and type int equal to 1, in the debug it was shown that if you enter 1 into type char instead of '1', it will perceive it as one, but display its character value '\u0001'.  
In class Task_3 the program determines whether the number entered on the console is even or odd.  
In class Task_4 the program determines whether the outside temperature is cold, warm or normal based on the temperature entered into the console.  
In class Task_5 the program displays squares of numbers from 10 to 20 to the console.  
In class Task_6 we output a sequence of numbers in increments of 7 to the console using a while loop.  
In class Task_7 We used the switch-case construct to display the name of the month by its number in the console.  
In additional_homework_3:  
In AdditionalTask_1 we output the Fibonacci sequence to the console, limited by the number specified by the user.
